# SpaceX Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Prediction 🚀

## Overview
This repository contains the complete code, analysis, and interactive dashboards for my **Data Science Capstone Project**, part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. 

The main objective of this project is to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, which is significantly cheaper than other providers, largely because they can reuse the first stage. By predicting the landing outcome, we can estimate the cost of a launch and provide valuable insights for competing companies.

## Key Findings & Results 📊
* **Launch Sites:** `KSC LC-39A` has the highest success rate among all launch sites.
* **Payload Mass:** Payloads between 2,000 kg and 5,000 kg yield the highest success rates.
* **Machine Learning:** Four classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN) were trained and optimized using `GridSearchCV`. All models achieved an impressive and identical test accuracy of **83.33%**.
